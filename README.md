# China-Public-Opinion-Visualization-System
## Background

With the rapid development of Internet technology and the popularization of social media such as mobile phones and the Internet in recent years, the amount of public opinion has increased exponentially. If a large amount of public opinion is not monitored in time, it will cause major social problems. Based on this, this article designs and develops a public opinion data analysis and visualization system to help organizations and governments quickly and intuitively understand real-time public opinion information.&#x20;

## Purpose

The project is based on the Python back-end framework and WEB front-end technology to realize the functions of public opinion data crawling, sentiment analysis, public opinion hotspots and public opinion events extraction, and public opinion data visualization.&#x20;

The system uses requests, bs4, and re libraries to write web crawlers to obtain public opinion content;&#x20;

uses excel as the structured data set for data storage and uses xlwt, xlrd and xlutils libraries for manipulation;&#x20;

uses senta-bilstm model for sentiment analysis;&#x20;

uses flask and Bootstrap to connect front and back ends and build web pages Public opinion visualization system template;

uses Echarts and DataTables to draw visual charts and tables;&#x20;

uses Jieba word-segment library and WordCloud library to make word cloud diagrams.&#x20;

## Advantages

Compared with the existing similar systems, it has many advantages.

First of all, the project fits the national conditions and is accurately positioned.

Secondly, the front and back ends of the system are available and the technology is complex.

Finally, the system code is templated and has high reusability.
